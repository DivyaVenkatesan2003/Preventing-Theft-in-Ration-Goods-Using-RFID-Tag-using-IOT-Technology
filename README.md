Title : Preventing theft in ration goods using rfid tag using iot technology
ABSTRACT:
.This project aims to prevent theft during transportation of ration goods by implementing an RFID-based stock clearance system.
.It integrates an Arduino UNO, NodeMCU for IoT connectivity, and LCD displays to ensure real-time monitoring and accountability.
.The system enforces the FIFO (First-In, First-Out) method for better inventory management, ensuring stock is cleared in order.
.RFID tags are used to track goods from godowns to PDS shops, ensuring accurate stock records and minimizing theft opportunities.
.NodeMCU enables remote monitoring and data transmission to a central server for seamless inventory management.
.The solution improves transparency, reduces theft, and optimizes ration distribution processes by maintaining accurate records at every steps
